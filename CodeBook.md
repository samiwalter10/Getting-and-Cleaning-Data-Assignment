# Code Book
This document summarizes the fields in the tidy_data.txt. The original HAR dataset was merged and cleaned in order to subset the mean acceleration and velocity for each physical activity across time. Each row includes an individual and one activity. There were 30 subjects (1 through 30) and six different activities.

## Identifiers
* subject - ID of the test subject
* activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## Activity Labels
* Walking
* Walking Upstairs
* Waling Downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying
